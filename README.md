# SparkSage

**Structured, question-aligned knowledge chunks for high-quality RAG.**

SparkSage replaces naive fixed-size text slicing with the **IdeaBlock** — a
small, self-contained *knowledge unit* that is aligned to how users ask
questions. Instead of embedding arbitrary text fragments (which get cut
mid-sentence and retrieve poorly), SparkSage embeds whole, verified answers.

> Status: **Pre-Alpha**. This repository currently implements the **chunk
> schema** (the foundational, most innovative layer). The Distill
> de-duplication pipeline and ingest service are planned.

## Why question-aligned chunks?

Traditional `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` chunks:

- get cut mid-sentence → semantic breakage,
- carry no notion of *what question they answer* → sparse vector clusters,
- lack queryable metadata → weak filtering / hybrid retrieval.

An IdeaBlock fixes all three at the data layer:

| Problem | IdeaBlock answer |
| --- | --- |
| Sentence breakage | Single-field embedding of a concise `trusted_answer` |
| No query alignment | Every block carries its `critical_question` |
| Poor metadata | `tags` / `entities` / `keywords` / provenance |

---

## The IdeaBlock schema

```xml
<ideablock>
  <name>标题 / short title</name>
  <critical_question>the single question this block answers?</critical_question>
  <trusted_answer>verified, self-consistent answer (2–3 sentences, ≤500 chars)</trusted_answer>
  <tags>IMPORTANT, TECHNOLOGY, ...</tags>
  <entity><entity_name>..</entity_name><entity_type>PRODUCT|..</entity_type></entity>
  <keywords>keywords for BM25 / lexical recall</keywords>
</ideablock>
```

Core model: [`src/sparksage/schema/ideablock.py`](src/sparksage/schema/ideablock.py).

### Design principles

- **Question–answer alignment** — `critical_question` + `trusted_answer` align
  the chunk to the query manifold, so dense vectors cluster tightly around
  user intent.
- **Single-field embedding** — only `trusted_answer` is embedded by default,
  killing the "splitter cut my sentence in half" problem. See
  [`embedding_text`](src/sparksage/schema/ideablock.py).
- **Rich, queryable metadata** — `tags` / `entities` / `keywords` power
  filtering, permission scoping and hybrid (BM25 + dense) retrieval.
- **Provenance & lifecycle** — every block knows its source
  ([`SourceRef`](src/sparksage/schema/source.py)) and dedup state
  (`status` / `parents`), so the corpus is auditable and the Distill pipeline
  can merge safely.

### TechnicalBlock (ordered content variant)

For manuals / SOPs / runbooks where *sequence is meaning*, the
[`TechnicalBlock`](src/sparksage/schema/technical.py) layers in:

- **ordered, role-tagged sentences** (`INFO` / `COMMAND` / `WARNING` /
  `PREREQUISITE` / `REFERENCE` / `RESULT`), and
- **Primary / Proceeding / Following** context windows.

It inherits the full IdeaBlock core, so it interoperates with the same
retrieval stack.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"

python3 - <<'PY'
from sparksage.schema import IdeaBlock, Tag, Entity, EntityType, BlockStatus

block = IdeaBlock(
    name="What SparkSage does",
    critical_question="What problem does SparkSage solve?",
    trusted_answer=(
        "SparkSage turns documents into question-aligned knowledge units so "
        "retrieval hits whole, self-contained answers instead of text shards."
    ),
    tags=[Tag.IMPORTANT, Tag.TECHNOLOGY],
    entities=[Entity(entity_name="SparkSage", entity_type=EntityType.PRODUCT)],
    keywords=["rag", "chunking"],
    status=BlockStatus.ACTIVE,
)
print(block.embedding_text)
print(block.to_xml())
PY
```
